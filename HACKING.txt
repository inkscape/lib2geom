Mailing list
============
Communication about this project occurs on the lib2geom mailing list:

	https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/lib2geom-devel

Help Wanted
===========
We greatly appreciate contributions.  You don't need to be a math-whiz or
über-hacker (though these are definitely appreciated :) ) to help.  The tasks of
code cleanup, consistency, testing, documentation, and toys mostly just require
perseverance, and benefit the project greatly.

As far as very specialized skill, we are always in need of mathy people, even if
it is just for their insight on problems and techniques (as opposed to coding).

Coding Style
============
Please refer to the Coding Style Guidelines
(http://www.inkscape.org/doc/coding_style.php) if you have specific questions
on the style to use for code.  If reading style guidelines doesn't interest
you, just follow the general style of the surrounding code, so that it is at
least internally consistent.

Compiling
=========
For windows instructions, see README.win32

For Debian-like platforms, the following packages are required:
 cairo v1.1.7 or later (Debian package libcairo2-dev)
 cmake
 make
 libboost-dev
 libgsl0-dev (though eventually it will only be required in tests)
 refblas3* on dapper

To compile, type ‘cmake .’ and then ‘make’.

If you have problems, just ask on the mailing list.

Running tests
=============
For Debian-like platforms, after compiling lib2geom, issue this command line
 make test

Adding a unit test
==================
Make sure you write it using GTest syntax - look at e.g.
src/2geom/tests/affine-test.cpp.

To add the test to the build,
add the test to src/2geom/tests/CMakeLists.txt in under
SET(2GEOM_GTESTS_SRC)
