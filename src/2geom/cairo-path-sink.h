/** @brief Output paths to a Cairo drawing context
 *
 * This class converts from 2Geom path representation to the Cairo representation.
 * Use it to simplify visualizing the results of 2Geom operations with the Cairo library,
 * for example:
 * @code
 *   CairoPathSink sink(cr);
 *   sink.feed(pv);
 *   cairo_stroke(cr);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Currently the flush method is a no-op, but this is not guaranteed
 * to hold forever.
